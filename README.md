# RasultChecker_API
This is a simple web application built with Flask that allows users to submit their exam results and see whether they passed or failed based on their average marks.
# Features
- Users can enter their marks for different subjects (Maths, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, and English).
- The application calculates the average marks and determines whether the user has passed or failed.
- If the average marks are equal to or greater than 35, the user is shown a "Pass" message along with their average marks.
- If the average marks are less than 35, the user is shown a "Fail" message along with their average marks.
